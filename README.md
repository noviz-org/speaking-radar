# B_APP

This is an App for blind and visually impaired people. 
It tells you points of interest based on your location enabelling them to explore the world around them.

## To Do

- The iPhone recognises if it is dropped and sends a signal tone and/or flashes

- Calculate the distance to the objects near you based on their and your position

- ViewController aufr√§umen

- Gitignore for API Key

## Ideas

- The iPhone recognises if it is dropped and sends a signal tone and/or flashes

- PlacesAPI_RequestManagement
  - Initially the phone pulls POI's with a greatere range than the App actually displays. 
  So you have two circles: an inner circle of displayed POI's and an outher circle with all the POI's pulled from the server.
  A new POI-request will be made if the inner circle crosses the outher circle. (not unlimited available requests)
